# BlackjackProject
## How To Run
### By Clicking on the play button, the program will start with asking if you would like to play a game of Blackjack or not. The user will be asked to type in yes or no to prompt the method of the program to start the game 
## Project Description
### The project is meant to be a small terminal version of Blackjack. The user will be given 2 cards with their total value as well as seeing the 1 card the dealer revealed. From there, the player will be asked to hit or stand which will add a card to their hand. After they bust or when they stand, the dealer then will draw cards until he has hit 17 or higher and then the progam will compare both of their values if they had not already busted and declare a winner
## Technologies Used
### There are a lot of methods used in this program as I wanted to break down the program into very small chunks. For loops, while loops, method calls, extensions, inheritance from different classes, all play roles within this project to perform the blackjack game function
## Lessons Learned
### At first when looking about how much stuff you have to do, the program can definitely be overwhelming. I think that building a lot of smaller methods that breaks down the code a bit was a lot easier for me to tackle in terms of piecing things together because a lot of the time, you can get very caught up and lost in the code and lose direction. From making small chunks and building a general layout of how you want the program to flow, just plugging in the missing pieces becomes a lot easier.
